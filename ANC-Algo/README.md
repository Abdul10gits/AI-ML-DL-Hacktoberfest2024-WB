# Adaptive Neural Complexity (ANC)

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a novel algorithm called **Adaptive Neural Complexity (ANC)**, developed for **Hacktoberfest 2024**. The ANC algorithm is designed to dynamically adjust the structure of a neural network (in terms of layers and neurons) based on the complexity of the input data, while also using meta-learning strategies to self-tune hyperparameters during training.

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Neural Architecture**: Automatically adds or prunes layers based on the complexity of the data being processed.
2. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameters**: A meta-controller that adjusts the learning rate, dropout rate, and other hyperparameters during training.
3. **Efficiency-Oriented**: Optimizes the architecture to maintain high performance with minimal resource usage.

## How It Works
1. **Data Complexity Evaluation**: The algorithm evaluates the complexity of the input data using a custom metric (e.g., gradient magnitude, loss variance).
2. **Network Structure Adaptation**: If the data complexity increases, the network dynamically adds layers. If it decreases, it prunes unnecessary layers.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: A meta-controller predicts the optimal hyperparameter values (learning rate, dropout rate) during training.
4. **Reinforcement Mechanism**: Reinforces efficient architectures that perform well with fewer resources.

## Code Structure
- **`adaptive_neural_complexity.py`**: Contains the core implementation of the ANC algorithm.
  - **NeuralNetwork**: Represents the dynamic neural network.
  - **MetaController**: Responsible for predicting the best hyperparameters.
  - **AdaptiveNeuralComplexity**: Orchestrates the dynamic architecture adjustment and hyperparameter tuning.

## Example Usage
```bash
# Run the main file to train the adaptive neural network
python adaptive_neural_complexity.py
```

The network starts with a shallow architecture and adjusts itself dynamically as it trains on batches of data.
